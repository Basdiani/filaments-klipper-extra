## ⚠️ WARNING

### Status: Alpha

This is new code and is not heavily tested.

If you are interested in more general discussion join this thread: https://klipper.discourse.group/t/assigning-a-filament-aka-thermal-preset-to-an-extruder/5849
Thanks for taking a look.

I'll take this warning down when the code is well tested and the GCode interface is stable.

# Filaments - Filament Presets for Klipper

# Installing

Clone this git repo to your printers home directory (e.g. /home/pi):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basdiani/filaments-klipper-extra.git
cd ~/filaments-klipper-extra
./install.sh
```

Then run the install script. The install script assumes that Klipper is also installed in your home directory under "klipper": `${HOME}/klipper`. Otherwise use ./install.sh -k "/path/to/klipper"


Optionally you can tell Moonraker's update manager about this plugin by 
adding this configuration block to the `moonraker.conf` of your printer:

```text
[update_manager client Filaments]
type: git_repo
path: ~/filaments-klipper-extra
primary_branch: mainline
origin: https://github.com/basdiani/filaments-klipper-extra.git
install_script: install.sh

# G-Code Commands
These commands handle basic tasks for filament presets

### [filament]
The following commands are available when a 
[filaments config section](#filaments) is enabled.

#### SETUP_FILAMENT
`SETUP_FILAMENT NAME=<value> [EXTRUDER=<extruder_temp>] [BED=<bed_temp>] [PROPERTY_NAME=<python_literal>]`: 
Create or update a filament preset. The NAME argument is required and must be at least 2 characters long. EXTRUDER and BED are floating point numbers. Any number of additional properties can be added and these will be stored in the filament preset. The values of these parameters can be any valid Python literal. The names must be valid python dictionary keys. Dictionary keys will be stored in lower case. Fields in the preset are overwritten if new values are provided but otherwise preserved.

#### DELETE_FILAMENT
`DELETE_FILAMENT NAME=<value>` Delete a filament preset. The NAME argument is
required.

#### SET_FILAMENT
`SET_FILAMENT NAME=<value> [EXTRUDER=<extruder>]`: Associate the filament preset with the extruder. The NAME parameter is required. The EXTRUDER parameter is the name of the extruder and is optional. The active extruder is used by default.

#### CLEAR_FILAMENT
`CLEAR_FILAMENT [EXTRUDER=<extruder>]`: Disassociate the extruder from the current filament preset, if any. The EXTRUDER parameter is the name of the extruder and is optional. The active extruder is used by default.

#### QUERY_FILAMENTS
`QUERY_FILAMENTS`: Prints the currently associated filament preset and the list of filament presets to the console.

#### PREHEAT_EXTRUDER
`PREHEAT_EXTRUDER [EXTRUDER=<extruder>]` Heat the extruder to the configured extruder temperature in the current filament preset. Will throw an error if no filament preset is assigned. The EXTRUDER parameter is the name of the extruder and is optional. The active extruder is used by default.

#### PREHEAT_BED

# Status Reference

## filaments
The following information is available in the `filaments` object:
- `profiles`: This is a list of all filament presets. Each entry is a filament preset dictionary containing the following keys:
  - `name`: The name of the filament preset.
  - `extruder`: The temperature of the extruder.
  - `bed`: The temperature of the extruder.
  - custom keys: If custom keys were provided to SETUP_FILAMENT they will also be included.

## extruder
The existing extruder object is extended to include a `filament` key that contains the assigned preset or `None`. The preset contains the following keys:
- `filament`
  - `name`: The name of the filament preset.
  - `extruder`: The temperature of the extruder.
  - `bed`: The temperature of the extruder.
  - custom keys: If custom keys were provided to SETUP_FILAMENT they will also be included.


# Usage Reference

## General Usage Notes
Typically you set up filaments and then assign them to the extruder:

```
SETUP_FILAMENT NAME=PLA EXTRUDER=220 BED=65
SETUP_FILAMENT NAME=PETG EXTRUDER=250 BED=85
SETUP_FILAMENT NAME="Nylon PA12" EXTRUDER=285 BED=110
SET_FILAMENT NAME=PETG
// extruder -> PETG - 250/85
QUERY_FILAMENTS
// Current Filaments:
// extruder: PETG - 250/85
// Filament Presets:
// PLA - 215/60
// PETG - 250/85
// Nylon PA12 - 285/110
```

Once set, filament presets and assignments are remembered across printer restarts. You can use this information in macros. Several macros are included to help with the most common heating tasks. These macros contain checks to make sure a filament preset is set and will abort any containing macro if it is not.

The order in which filaments are created with `SETUP_FILAMENT` is preserved. This might be a good ordering to display filament in a front end as it could represent a user's preferred ordering (i.e. most often used filaments first).

Filament names are case preserving but case insensitive. `pla` and `PLA` refer to the same preset but will be displayed as written. Whenever you run `SETUP_FILAMENT` the case you set in the `NAME` parameter is saved.

## Adding Additional Filament Properties
Each filament preset can have additional custom properties saved with it. For example, you can store a chamber temperature with the filament:

```
SETUP_FILAMENT NAME=ASA EXTRUDER=260 BED=100 CHAMBER=50
```

Property names need to be valid python dictionary keys. The values can be any python literal (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and dictionaries all work). Custom properties can be updated after the filament is created. Only the properties you want to change need to be passed in:

```
SETUP_FILAMENT NAME=ASA CHAMBER=40
```

Custom properties can be accessed in macros as properties of the filament object:

```
{printer.extruder.filament.chamber}
```


## Filament Loading & Unloading
A common FDM printer task is loading and unloading filament. With an assigned filament you can add a `HEAT_EXTRUDER_AND_WAIT` command to your macros to get the extruder up to temp before moving the extruder. e.g. using the sample macro from [Klipper Screen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/macros/#load_filament-unload_filament)
we only have to add 1 line:

```
[gcode_macro LOAD_FILAMENT]
gcode:
    {% set speed = params.SPEED|default(300) %}
    {% set max_velocity = printer.configfile.settings['extruder'].max_extrude_only_velocity %}
    SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=load_state

    HEAT_EXTRUDER_AND_WAIT  # make sure extruder is up to temp

    M300 # beep
    G91
    G92 E0
    G1 E350 F{max_velocity} # fast-load
    G1 E25 F{speed} # purge
    M300
    M300
    RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=load_state
```

### Front End Improvement Suggestions
Front ends that want to automate this process or implement a `CHANGE_FILAMENT` procedure can use `printer.filaments.extruders.extruder` to check if a filament is assigned to the extruder and if not, display the filament preset list (from `printer.filaments.presets`) to allow the user to select a filament preset.

`CLEAR_FILAMENT` can be used to clear the association between the extruder and the filament preset. Calls to `HEAT_*` will fail with an error. The preset value is `None` and the front end can prompt the user to select a filament before executing the load/unload filament operation.

## `PRINT_START` and Calibration Prints

Klipper strongly suggests that users create a `PRINT_START` macro that takes in the extruder and bed temperatures. This works well if a slicer is passing those parameters in to the print. But for calibration prints run from the machine there is no slicer. This has led to each macro attempting to do its own internal `PRINT_START` e.g. [PA_CAL](https://github.com/ksanislo/klipper-pa_cal/blob/master/src/pa_cal.cfg). This has hampered efforts to share calibration print macros as they are very unlikely to work with your printer without modification.

[filaments] can help here to make the `PRINT_START` macro work when there is a filament set but no temperatures were provided by the slicer:

```
[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
gcode:
    {% set EXTRUDER_TEMP = params.EXTRUDER_TEMP|default(0)|float %}
    {% set BED_TEMP = params.BED_TEMP|default(0)|float %}

    {% if EXTRUDER_TEMP and BED_TEMP %}
        M104 S{EXTRUDER_TEMP}  # heat up the extruder
        M140 S{BED_TEMP}       # heat up the bed
    {% else %}
        PREHEAT   # start heating the exturder and bed based on filament preset
                  # will halt the print if no preset is set
    {% endif %}

    # do print start tasks, homing, bed mesh etc...

    # before we start printing, make sure the extruder and bed have reached temp:
    {% if EXTRUDER_TEMP and BED_TEMP %}
        M109 S{EXTRUDER_TEMP}  # heat up the extruder
        M190 S{BED_TEMP}       # heat up the bed
    {% else %}
        HEAT_AND_WAIT   # heat both and wait for both based on filament preset
    {% endif %}
```

Now you can call `PRINT_START` with no arguments and it will just work. Creating a calibration print is therefor less complex. Lets take PA_CAL as an example:

 ```
 PRINT_START
 PA_CAL
 PRINT_END
 ```

Put that gcode in a file in the [virtial_sdcard] folder and call it `pa-cal.gcode`.

`PA_CAL` needs extra parameters but we can pass them via variables on the `PA_CAL` macro object:

```
[gcode_macro START_PA_CAL]
description: Print a Pressure Advance test pattern
gcode:
    # configure pressure advance
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=PA_CAL VARIABLE=extrusion_factor VALUE={extrusion_factor}
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=PA_CAL VARIABLE=nozzle VALUE={nozzle}

    # run print job
    SDCARD_PRINT_FILE FILENAME="pa-cal.gcode"
```

Now the macro runs as a print rather than as a macro so it can be paused or canceled. Most of the front ends will present a nice UI for entering these additional parameters. We should expect a lot more re-usable calibration macros using this technique.

## Reacting to Filament Changes

All of the klipper front ends allow you to run custom gcode when a preset is selected. But they don't pass any context information about the filament change so this feature is of limited value. Instead of this gcode per-preset approach, [filaments] supports macros that are triggered when a filament is set or cleared. These macros get passed useful context information about the filament change including the extruder, new filament preset and previous filament preset.

Here is an example of using these macros just to print out that information:

```
[filaments]
on_set_filament_gcode: 
    {action_respond_info("Filament Set. extruder: %s, T=%i, preset: %s, last_preset: %s" % (params.EXTRUDER, params.T, params.PRESET | string, params.LAST_PRESET | string))}
on_clear_filament_gcode:
    {action_respond_info("Filament Cleared. extruder: %s, T=%i, last_preset: %s" % (params.EXTRUDER, params.T, params.LAST_PRESET | string))}
```

sample output:
```
$ SET_FILAMENT NAME=PETG
// Filament Set. extruder: extruder, T=0, preset: {'name': 'PETG', 'extruder': 280.0, 'bed': 90.0}, last_preset: None
$ SET_FILAMENT NAME=PLA
// Filament Set. extruder: extruder, T=0, preset: {'name': 'PLA', 'extruder': 215.5, 'bed': 45.0}, last_preset: {'name': 'PETG', 'extruder': 280.0, 'bed': 90.0}
$ CLEAR_FILAMENT
// Filament Cleared. extruder: extruder, T=0, last_preset: {'name': 'PLA', 'extruder': 215.5, 'bed': 45.0}
```

I'm not super familiar with what people are using the gcode blocks in the existing front ends for but hopefully this is more useful and maintainable. This also has the benefit of
working across all front ends hooked up to klipper without having to copy your gcode to multiple places. Feedback is welcome.
